      "contents": "\nOutside academia\nWe do a fair a bit of training and consulting outside academia. We do\nthis because for two main reasons:\nwe rely on some of our consulting fees to finance our research\nactivities.\nwe are well aware that conservation involves many actors that do not\nbelong to universities or public research institutes.\nIf you are interested, please contact us.\nTopics\nOur technical expertise lies in R programming (from\nintroduction to R package development), data manipulation (in\nR), data visualisation (with or without R) and data\nanalysis (in particular: traditional statistical tests, generalised\nlinear models, mixed models, spatial analyses, survival analyses, random\nforests, individual-based simulations).\nYet, as long as we feel competent enough to be useful, we are happy\nto offer consulting or training on any topic.\nWe always highly customise the content of training sessions to match\nthe task and requirement of the client.\nHere are some representative examples of the training &\nconsulting we are currently providing:\nworkshop for data visualisation organised by XXX.\ndevelopment of R packages and advanced R training for all data\nscientists at Factworks, a\nmarket research and analytic company.\nsupport in statistical analyses for the Nature and Biodiversity\nConservation Union in Germany (NABU),\nthe World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) and the conservation NGO\nrewild.\nJust write to us and\nwe will happily put you in contact with people we worked with for you to\nget direct feedback on how they perceived our work.\nPricing and the Robin Hood model\nOur pricing depends on the content, as well as on the number and\nidentity of both the members from our team and the client(s).\nIf the work is for a for profit company, our default protocol is to\nrequest the company to either pay our hosting institution (the IZW) or to pay one of\nthe non-profit foundations we work with. In both cases, the money is\nused by us as a third party support to our research. We call this the\nRobin Hood model, but this is hardly stealing: we remain very\ncompetitive compared to fees required by equally qualified free lancers\nout there.\nIf the work is related to wildlife conservation or other activities\nwe consider as highly beneficial to society as a whole, we try to be as\ncheap as we can.\nFor a quote, please contact us.\nAvailability\nOur availability is what constrains the amount of consulting we do.\nWe can arrange regular short consultations or block consulting for\nduration of up to 10 days, but we cannot offer more. If you need more,\njust contact us and we\nwill attempt to connect you to former members of the group and other\npeople we know and trust who have become free lancers.\nWithin academia\nWe do not consult within academia with the exception of our local\ncolleagues and students, as well as users of the methods we develop.\nInstead, we favour genuine collaborations where our role is not\nlimited to performing the data analysis of someone else project.\nIf you are interested, please contact us.\nWe also teach both at the IZW and at the FU (see teaching for details).\n\n\n\n",

He is mostly interested in humans,\nwild mammals and birds. His favorite research projects are those\nrevealing unexpected outcomes. His focus is on questions related to life\nhistory and behaviour, but he is always open to new exciting\ncollaborations. He likes programming and teaching R.\nLiam Bailey🇦🇺 (member\nsince 2018) .\nPostdoc. SHORT 3rd PERSON DESCRIPTION TODO.\nPast members\nColin\nVullioud🇨🇭 (20XX-20XX) came to us after getting fed up with social\nscience research, learned R with us, turned social behavior into\nalgorithms and left as a full fledged data scientist currently working\nas a free lancer in Berlin, Germany. He also created the R package\n{torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}.\nElisa\nDonati🇮🇹 (2020) came to programs virtual hyenas and to work our R\npackage {hyneaR} between a master on lizards and an upcoming PhD student\nin Italy.\nIan Rickard🇬🇧\n(20XX) came for a sabbatical from Durham University to study how\ntwinning connects to fertility in humans, then switched career to become\na data scientist for the ministry of justice in the UK.\nLouise Chevalier🇫🇷 (20XX) came for a few months during her PhD to\ndo something else for a while. She worked with us on adding genetics to\na simulation model about hyenas. Now a circus artist in France.\nRobert\nSchwieger🇩🇪 (20XX) came to do maths for fun on inference problems\nabout mate choice before doing a PhD in mathematics. Now working at CENTOGENE in Berlin,\nGermany.\nCamille\nMartinez🇫🇷 (200X) did a joint-internship here and in Montpellier\ndeveloping stats methods to draw inference using simulation before\nstarting her PhD. Currently doing a postdoc in Grenoble,\nFrance.\nLoïc Etienne🇫🇷 (20XX) did his PhD with us doing modelling about\nthe evolution of mutual mate choice.

      "contents": "\nWho are we?\nThe Data Zoo Gang is a small team of\nscientists (mostly biologists) with a slight geeky data driven take\non wildlife and humans.\nWe all love mammals, birds, computers and R.\nWe enjoy collaborating with people – whoever they are – as long as\nthey really want to discover something cool and not too obvious about\ntheir favorite species.\nWe hate demonstrating the obvious, and strongly dislike low quality\ndatasets and proprietary software (although we sometimes use both).\nWhat do we do?\nWe embrace eclecticsm and draw concepts from ecology, evolution,\ndemography and conservation to tackle our questions.\nAt the technical level, we mix statistics and programming (with an\noccasional dash of mathematical modeling) to analyse data collected in\nthe wild so as to solve puzzles about wildlife conservation, the ecology\nand evolution of life history traits, animal behaviour, as well as to\nbetter understand various aspects of health in wildlife populations\n(check out our publications for more\ndetails).\nWe also create open source tools (R\npackages) for researchers from these communities, teach stats, experimental design, and R\nprogramming, and offer consulting and\ntraining both within and outside academia.\nWhere are we based?\nWe are based at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research\nin Berlin, Germany (or IZW for short). Some\nof us occasionally do a little bit of field work in Tanzania as also\nmember of the hyena project not\nto loose track with the real world.\nWhy are we called Data Zoo\nGang?\nWe call our team, the Data Zoo Gang or DZG (pronounced\n“deezeegee”) for short.\nData because that is the raw material for almost\neverything we do.\nZoo because we work on animals and are also based\nnext to an animal\npark.\nGang because there is a nicer rhythm to it than\ngroup or team and because we are almost rebels:\nwe think that developing methods is a scientific activity on its own\nright, which should be better recognized and funded as such.\nwe think that most null hypothesis testing is dull.\nwe show no mercy to data, flimsy ideas (no matter how established)\nand computers.\none past team member unconditionally wore baseball caps and there is\nalso a somewhat anti-capitalist vibe within the group but remain\ntolerant and professional, especially since we consult for profit\ncompanies under a Robin Hood\nmodel.\nAll the same, we love collaborating with field biologists, NGOs, or\ngeeks from any background.\nHow to join us?\nIf you would like to join us and are a motivated scientist with\noverlapping interests, no matter your skills, origin, age, sex &\ngender, please do contact\nus and we will figure out the details together.\n\n\n\n",
