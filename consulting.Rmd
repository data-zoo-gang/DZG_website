   We offer training and consulting about R, statistics, data visualisation and anything else we know for everyone.

## Outside academia

We do a fair a bit of training and consulting outside academia.
We do this because for two main reasons:

- we rely on some of our consulting fees to finance our research activities.
- we are well aware that conservation involves many actors that do not belong to universities or public research institutes.

If you are interested, please [contact us](mailto: courtiol@izw-berlin.de).

### Topics

Our technical expertise lies in *R programming* (from introduction to R package development), *data manipulation* (in R), *data visualisation* (with or without R) and *data analysis* (in particular: traditional statistical tests, generalised linear models, mixed models, spatial analyses, survival analyses, random forests, individual-based simulations).

Yet, as long as we feel competent enough to be useful, we are happy to offer consulting or training on any topic.

We always highly customise the content of training sessions to match the task and requirement of the client.

Here are some representative examples of the training & consulting we are currently providing:

- workshop for data visualisation organised by XXX.

- development of R packages and advanced R training for all data scientists at [Factworks](https://www.factworks.com), a market research and analytic company.

- support in statistical analyses for the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union in Germany ([NABU](https://en.nabu.de)), the World Wildlife Foundation ([WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/)) and the conservation NGO [rewild](https://www.rewild.org).

Just [write to us](mailto: courtiol@izw-berlin.de) and we will happily put you in contact with people we worked with for you to get direct feedback on how they perceived our work.


### Pricing and the Robin Hood model {#robinhood}

Our pricing depends on the content, as well as on the number and identity of both the members from our team and the client(s).

If the work is for a for profit company, our default protocol is to request the company to either pay our hosting institution (the [IZW](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/home.html)) or to pay one of the non-profit foundations we work with.
In both cases, the money is used by us as a third party support to our research.
We call this the *Robin Hood model*, but this is hardly stealing: we remain very competitive compared to fees required by equally qualified free lancers out there.

If the work is related to wildlife conservation or other activities we consider as highly beneficial to society as a whole, we try to be as cheap as we can.

For a quote, please [contact us](mailto: courtiol@izw-berlin.de).


### Availability

Our availability is what constrains the amount of consulting we do.
We can arrange regular short consultations or block consulting for duration of up to 10 days, but we cannot offer more.
If you need more, just [contact us](mailto: courtiol@izw-berlin.de) and we will attempt to connect you to former members of the group and other people we know and trust who have become free lancers.


## Within academia

We do not consult within academia with the exception of our local colleagues and students, as well as users of the methods we develop.

Instead, we favour genuine collaborations where our role is not limited to performing the data analysis of someone else project.

If you are interested, please [contact us](mailto: courtiol@izw-berlin.de).

We also teach both at the [IZW](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/home.html) and at the [FU](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) (see [teaching](teaching.html) for details).
