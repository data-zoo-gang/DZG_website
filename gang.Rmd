<img src="images/alex_courtiol.jpg" width="200px">
Member since 2012. [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> <i class='fa fa-flask'></i>](https://twitter.com/alexcourtiol), [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> <i class='fab fa-r-project'></i>](https://twitter.com/rdataberlin).
Senior researcher, lecturer. Initially trained as an evolutionary biologist with an additional emphasis on applied statistics, Alex has adopted ecology and demography after his PhD. He is mostly interested in humans, wild mammals and birds. His favorite research projects are those revealing unexpected outcomes. His focus is on questions related to life history and behaviour, but he is always open to new exciting collaborations. He likes programming and teaching R.

<img src="images/liam_bailey.jpg" width="200px">
Member since 2018. [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i>](https://twitter.com/ldbailey255).
Postdoc. Liam is interested in understanding how ecosystems are affected by and respond to environmental change, particularly in the context of climate change. His research often involves long-term demographic datasets, and he loves using R and his experience as a data scientist to work with these data and answer scientific questions. While he started his research with birds, Liam has now branched out to include research with wild mammals. He also enjoys data visualization and teaching others how to visually communicate their ideas and scientific findings.

<img src="images/colin_vullioud.jpg" width="200px">
Member 2017-2021.
Colin came to us after getting fed up with social science research, learned R with us, and turned social behavior into algorithms.
He also created the R package {torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}.
He left the DZG as a fully fledged data scientist currently working as a freelancer in Berlin, Germany.
He is also an artist who has started to include R in his projects.

Member 2020. 
Elisa came to program virtual hyenas and to work on our R package {hyneaR}.
She did this between a master's thesis on lizards and a research project that involved setting up a complex simulation platform so as to model the coastal ecosystem of Venice, with a view to allowing sustainable exploitation by humans.
She now continues modelling coastal ecosystems, this time as a PhD student in Trieste, Italy.

Member 2019.
Louise came for a few months during her PhD to do something else for a while. She worked with us on adding genetics to a simulation model about hyenas.
Then, she returned to her PhD -- building fancy demo-genetics models to better understand the role of demography and genomic constraints on the evolution of mate choice.
She is now a circus artist in France.

Member 2015-2016.
Camille did a joint internship here and in Montpellier developing stats methods to draw inferences using simulations. She then applied her statistics skills during her master's project and PhD to study interactions in soil between plants and other lifeforms, across alpine elevation gradients. She is currently doing a postdoc in Grenoble, France.

He was co-supervised by Alex, our long standing collaborator [FranÃ§ois Rousset](#FR), and [Bernard Godelle](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernard-Godelle-2). 
After his PhD, LoÃ¯c worked as a high-school teacher, and he is now a full time musician in France.
