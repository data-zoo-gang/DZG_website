We found the possibility to write a few\nlines of custom R code so as to generate tables of publications\nautomatically particularly convenient. The relevant references are\nselected from a BibTeX file on the basis of key words attached to the\nentries.\nYou can check our GitHub repository \nto see how we coded everything, and you can check the distillery for other websites\ncreated using {distill}.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nContents\nOutside academia\nWithin academia\n\nOutside academia\nWe do a fair a bit of training and consulting outside academia. We do\nthis for two main reasons:\nwe rely on some of our consulting fees to finance our research\nactivities.\nwe are aware that conservation involves many actors who do not\nbelong to universities or public research institutes.\nIf you are interested, please contact us.\nTopics\nOur technical expertise lies in R programming (including\npackage development), data wrangling (in R), data\nvisualisation (with or without R) and data analysis (in\nparticular: traditional statistical tests, generalised linear models,\nmixed models, spatial analyses, survival analyses, random forests,\nindividual-based simulations).\nYet as long as we feel competent enough to be useful, we are happy to\noffer consulting or training on any topic.\nWe always customise the content of training sessions to match the\ntasks and requirements of the client.\nHere are some representative examples of the training &\nconsulting we are currently providing:\nworkshop for data visualisation organised by XXX.\ndevelopment of R packages and advanced R training for all data\nscientists at Factworks, a\nmarket research and analytics company.\nsupport in statistical analyses for the Nature and Biodiversity\nConservation Union in Germany (NABU),\nthe World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) and the conservation NGO\nrewild.\nJust write to us and\nwe will happily put you in contact with people we worked with for you to\nget direct feedback on how they perceived our work.\nPricing and the Robin Hood model\nOur pricing depends on the content, as well as on the number and\nidentity of both the members from our team and the client’s.\nIf the work is for a for-profit company, our default protocol is to\nrequest the company to either pay our hosting institution (the IZW) or to pay one of\nthe non-profit foundations we work with. In both cases, the money is\nused by us as third party support for our research. We call this the\nRobin Hood model, but this is hardly stealing: we remain very\ncompetitive compared to fees asked by equally qualified freelancers out\nthere.\nIf the work is related to wildlife conservation or other activities\nwe consider as highly beneficial to society as a whole, we try to\nprovide a discount.\nFor a quote, please contact us.\nAvailability\nOur availability is what constrains the amount of consulting we do.\nWe can arrange regular short consultations or block consulting for a\nduration of up to 10 days, but we cannot offer more. If you need more,\njust contact us and we\nwill attempt to connect you to former members of the group and other\npeople we know and trust who have become freelancers.\nWithin academia\nWe do not consult within academia with the exception of our local\ncolleagues and students, as well as users of the methods we develop.\nInstead, we favour genuine collaborations where our role is not\nlimited to performing the data analysis of someone else’s project.\nIf you are interested, please contact us.\nWe also teach both at the IZW and at the FU (see teaching for details).\n\n\n\n",

SHORT 3rd PERSON DESCRIPTION TODO.\n\nFormer members\nColin\nVullioud 🇨🇭\n\n Member 2017-2021.\nColin came to us after getting fed up with social science research,\nlearned R with us, and turned social behavior into algorithms. He also\ncreated the R package {torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}. He left the\nDZG as a fully fledged data scientist currently working as a freelancer\nin Berlin, Germany. He is also an artist who has started to include R in\nhis projects.\n\nElisa\nDonati 🇮🇹\n\n Member 2020. Elisa\ncame to program virtual hyenas and to work on our R package {hyneaR}.\nShe did this between a master’s thesis on lizards and a research project\nthat involved setting up a complex simulation platform so as to model\nthe coastal ecosystem of Venice, with a view to allowing sustainable\nexploitation by humans. She is now looking for a PhD in Italy (too bad\nfor us, otherwise we would have kept her here in Berlin!).\n\nLouise Chevalier 🇫🇷\n\n Member 2019.\nLouise came for a few months during her PhD to do something else for a\nwhile. She worked with us on adding genetics to a simulation model about\nhyenas. Then, she returned to her PhD – building fancy demo-genetics\nmodels to better understand the role of demography and genomic\nconstraints on the evolution of mate choice. She is now a circus artist\nin France.\n\nIan\nRickard 🇬🇧\n\n Member 2017-2018.\nIan came for a sabbatical from Durham University to study how twinning\nconnects to fertility in humans, then switched career to become a data\nscientist for the ministry of justice in the UK. Ian and Alex were both\npostdocs in the same team in Sheffield (UK) headed by our collaborator\nVirpi Lummaa.\n\nRobert\nSchwieger 🇩🇪\n\n Member 2015-2016.

She is currently doing a postdoc in\nGrenoble, France.\n\nLoïc Etienne 🇫🇷\n\n Member 2012-2014.\nLoïc did his PhD with us, modelling the evolution of mutual mate choice.\nHe was co-supervised by Alex, our long standing collaborator François Rousset, and Bernard\nGodelle. After his PhD, Loïc worked as a high-school teacher, and he\nis now a full time musician in France.\n\nFriends\nNot quite members, not quite collaborators, but very close to us all\nthe same!\nJörns\nFickel 🇩🇪\n\n Jörns Fickel is\nthe wise Sensei in\ncharge of the IZW Department\nof Evolutionary Genetics to which we belong. He is also leading the\ncourse on\nconservation genetics to which we contribute. We are delighted that\nhe has our back, and effectively defend our interests within the IZW and\nbeyond.\n\nIlja Heckmann 🇰🇿🇩🇪\nIlja is a biologist colleague turned full time python programmer and\nLinux admin from whom we never stop learning.\nZimai\nLi 🇨🇳\n\n Zimai worked with us on\nour R package {hyneaR} while doing an internship with colleagues from\nthe hyena project on mate choice\nin spotted hyenas. After his stay with us, he joined Yuko Ulrich to study\ninteractions between infections and behaviour in clonal raider ants.\n\nMatthias\nGallipaud 🇫🇷\n\n Matthias is a\nlong standing idea bouncer for the DZG. He did his PhD with François Xavier Dechaume-Moncharmont who\nwas in Dijon at the time (now in Lyon) and then a postdoc with Hanna Kokko in Zurich, Switzerland.\nMatthias stayed in Zurich and is currently a data scientist working for\nUrbanDataLab, a startup\nspecialising in GIS and spatial analyses. He also does statistical\nconsulting, on the side, as a freelancer.\n\nMain collaborators\nFrançois\nRousset 🇫🇷\n\n François is a\ntheoretical biologist at the Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution in\nMontpellier, France, turned hardcore statistician, author of R\npackage {spaMM} without which we could not do half the work we do.\n\nOliver\nHöner 🇨🇭🇧🇷\n\n Oliver is the\nleader of the hyena project.\nHe’s a behavioral ecologist and field biologist who turns anything hyena\nrelated into high quality datasets. We also collaborate intensively with\nhis students – currently Eve\nDavidian and Arjun Dheer. Oliver\nis based in the department of Evolutionary Ecology at the IZW.\n\nViktoriia Radchuk 🇺🇦\n\n Viktoriia is\nan individual-based modeler and the producer of big collaborative\nmeta-analyses. Like us she flourishes at the interface between field and\ntheory. She is a key member of the department of Ecological Dynamics at\nthe IZW.\n\nStephanie\nKramer-Schadt 🇩🇪\n\n Stephanie is\nhead of the excellent department Ecological Dynamics at\nthe IZW which is\ncomposed, almost exclusively, of great young scientists and students\nwith strong quantitative skills.\n\nKseniia\nKravchenko 🇺🇦\n\n Kseniia has\nfreshly finished her PhD at the BatLab from the IZW. She is a batwomen\nwith whom we try to predict the future distribution of hibernation\nniches by combining physiology and climate change.\n\nChristian\nVoigt 🇩🇪\n\n Christian is\nhead of the department of Evolutionary Ecology at the IZW and head of the BatLab. His large team studies the\necophysiology of bats, as well as various topics relevant for the\nconservation of bats, such as their migration.\n\nVirpi\nLummaa 🇫🇮\n\n Virpi is the life\nhistory data queen who has produced two of the very best demographic\ndatasets that exist (one on pre-industrial humans and one on Asian\nElephants). She is head of the human life history science\ngroup and of the Myanmar\nTimber Elephant Project at the University of Turku in Finland.\n\nCollaborators wishlist\nThey never worked with us, but are very much like us, so we hope to\nwork with them one day: Sarah\nCubaynes 🇫🇷, Olivier\nGimenez 🇫🇷, Samuel\nPavard 🇫🇷, François Xavier\nDechaume-Moncharmont 🇫🇷. There is also Erik Postma 🇳🇱 with whom we\nworked a little already, but we would love to do more with him.\n\n\n\n",

Some\nof us occasionally do field work in Tanzania as members of the hyena project, so as not to lose\ntrack of the real world.\nWhy are we called Data Zoo\nGang?\nWe call our team, the Data Zoo Gang or DZG (pronounced\n“deezeegee”) for short.\nData because that is the raw material for almost\neverything we do.\nZoo because we work on animals and are also based\nnext to an animal\npark.\nGang because there is a nicer rhythm to it than\ngroup or team and because we are almost rebels:\nwe think that developing methods is a scientific activity in its own\nright, which should be better recognized and funded as such.\nwe think that most null hypothesis testing is dull.\nwe show no mercy to data, flimsy ideas (no matter how established)\nor computers.\nthere is also a somewhat anti-capitalist vibe within the group; but\nwe remain tolerant and professional, especially since we consult for\nprofit companies under a Robin Hood\nmodel.\nHow to join us?\nWe love collaborating with field biologists, NGOs, or geeks from any\nbackground.\nIf you would like to join us and are a motivated scientist with\noverlapping interests, no matter your skills, origin, age, sex &\ngender, please do contact\nus and we will figure out the details together.\n\n\n\n",

Created\nand maintained by Liam.\n{IsoriX} \n\nto build isoscapes using mixed models and infer the geographic origin of\norganisms based on their isotopic ratios. Created and maintained by\nAlex.\n{torpor} \nto fit thermoregulatory curves in heterothermic endotherm species, while\nassigning metabolic rates to the correct physiological state. Created\nand maintained by Colin.\n{camtrapR} \n\nto manage camera trap photographs in wildlife studies. We helped its\nmaintainer – Jürgen Niedballa – to set it up while he was still a PhD\nstudent.\nFor all data scientists\n{spaMM} \n\nto efficiently fit linear models of varying complexity, including mixed\nmodels with spatial autocorrelation. We contribute to its development\nmostly by using this package a lot, debugging it and suggesting new\nfeatures. Maintained by one very close collaborator (François\nRousset).\n{ABMR6} \nan example of how to implement individual-based simulations using R6.\nCreated by Alex, maintained by Liam.\n{timevarcorr} \nto estimate time varying correlation coefficients using non-parametric\nkernel smoothing. Created and maintained by Alex.\nPrivate (for now)\n{hyenaR} \nto manage most of the data generated by the hyena project. Created and\nmaintained by Liam and Alex.\n{HyenaPopmod} \nto perform individual-based simulations mimicking the hyenas followed by\nthe hyena project. Created and\nmaintained by Liam.\nThese packages will become open when we judge them ready for others\nto use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For teaching\noutside academia, please refer to our page on consulting. All courses are taught\nin English.\nCurrent teaching and\nworkshops\n\n\nData\nscience for biologists: Generalized linear modelling with R\nAlex teaches this\ncourse every even year at the Freie Universität in Berlin (FU for\nshort).\nIt is designed for master’s and PhD students from the department of biology,\nchemistry and pharmacy at the FU, but students from other\nuniversities can easily do the necessary paperwork to take part.\nThe course takes place during the summer semester and currently runs\nfor 40 hours in class (2 full days a week, for 4 consecutive weeks).\nThe goal of this course is to teach students how to analyse most\ndatasets on their own, and derive biological meaning from them. The\ncourse specifically focuses on Generalised Linear Models (or GLMs for\nshort) – a family of statistical models that aim to describe the effect\nof different variables on one outcome of interest. The GLM is the most\nuseful statistical tool for most natural scientists. It is also the\nfoundation of more complex methods, such as AI algorithms. During this\ncourse students study GLMs in depth, favoring practical considerations\nover mathematics. By the end of the course, they should be able to use a\nwide range of GLMs (i.e. LM, GLM, LMM, GLMM) and understand how to solve\nseveral common practical problems that show up when analysing real\ndatasets. They will also learn how to translate a concrete biological\nproblem into a GLM. All that is done with the open source software R,\nwhich is the most popular software for data science in the world.\n\n\n\nIntroductory\ncourse: Solving problems in biostatistical analysis and experimental\ndesign in the Life Sciences\nAlex teaches this course at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and\nWildlife Research (or IZW).\nIt is designed for PhD students from the IZW as well as those\nbelonging to one of the following programs:\nthe Research\nTraining Group 2046 Parasite Infections: From Experimental Models to\nNatural Systems also known as GRK 2046 or Grako.\nthe International\nMax Planck Research School for Infectious Diseases and Immunology\nalso known as IMPRS.\nthe Graduate School of the Interdisciplinary\nCenter of Infection Biology and Immunity also known as ZIBI.\nthe Dahlem Research\nSchool also known as DRS.\nThe course is a 5-day block course occurring twice every year: once\nin November or December and once in January or February (exact dates\ndepend on the year).\nThis is an introductory course, so no preliminary knowledge in\nstatistics or R is required. It is however helpful if students have\ntheir research questions and experimental designs in mind. On day 1,\nAlex reviews the basics of the statistical software and programming\nlanguage called R. On days 2-3,\nhe teaches fundamental concepts in statistics such as: population,\nsample, distribution, null hypothesis, statistical significance,\np-values, statistical power, multiple testing, replications… On days\n3-4, he introduces several useful non-parametric tests. On days 4-5, he\nintroduces linear models (LM, GLM) and a few other parametric tests that\nare good to know.\n\n\n\nConservation Genetics\nAlex and Liam perform some of the teaching of a course on\nConservation Genetics (Naturschutzgenetik) organised by Jörns Fickel for the University\nof Potsdam.\nAlex teaches a 1-day course on R for genetics and genomics with Daniel\nFörster.\nLiam teaches an introduction to R.\n\n\n\nInternational\nsummer school on stable isotopes in Animal Ecology\nEvery other year, Christian\nVoigt organises a summer school aiming to give PhD students an\noverall introduction to the various uses of stable isotopes in the study\nof animal ecology.\nIn this context, Alex gives a 1-day course on how to use IsoriX, an R package that can be\nused to infer the origin of migratory lifeforms based on their isotopic\nsignatures.\n\n\n\nWorking\nwith weather station data in Ngorongoro Crater\nLiam teaches how to work with data from our network of weather\nstations in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (see a report of our data\nhere).\nWe include both introductory techniques using Microsoft Excel and more\nadvanced techniques in R. This workshop is run for the Ngorongoro\nConservation Area Authority, which allows local conservation managers to\nuse weather data for their conservation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer teaching\n\n\nAdvanced\ncourse: Solving problems in biostatistical analysis and experimental\ndesign in the Life Sciences\nAlex taught this course, for several years, at the Leibniz Institute\nfor Zoo and Wildlife Research (or IZW).\nThe point of this course was primarily to discuss and resolve every\nparticipant’s (statistical) problem.\nThe course is no longer running since it became redundant with the\nfortnightly statistical seminars at the IZW, which we co-organise with\nEmanuel\nHeitlinger.\n\nOther former courses\n\n - In Berlin (Germany), Alex\nhas taught the course Current and classic topics in Evolution\nand Ecology at the Freie Universität, to replace Jens\nRolff who was on sabbatical.\n\n\n - In Sheffield (UK), during\nhis postdoc, Alex taught an introduction to R with Andrew Beckerman.\n\n\n - In Montpellier (France),\nduring his PhD, Alex taught population genetics and various practicals\nin ecology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
